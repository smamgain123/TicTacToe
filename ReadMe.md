# TicTacToe
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe built with React + Vite. Uses functional components (Square, Board, Game) and React hooks for state, move history, and turn tracking. Includes win detection via calculateWinner, click guards to prevent invalid moves, and a clean grid UI. Great starter project to learn props, immutability, and event handling.
